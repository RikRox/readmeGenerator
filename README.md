  # README Generator
  
  ## Description
  This project allows you to generate a professional readme from the cmd prompt. You will be asked to enter information such as installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, tests, licensing information, and personal information for ways people can reach out to you if they have any questions. This will then generate a professional README document.

  USER STORY: As a developer I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
